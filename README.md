This is the code for my and Vassilis Georgelis master thesis on federated learning called "Benchmarking of Machine Learning Models in a Federated Setting, Comparing Recurrent Neural Networks in a Federated Setting for Natural Language Processing"

The code is explained more in detail in the report availible under implementation.
